**ofdm_qam16_link.m** is a link simulation that includes ofdm modulation with pilot and null carrier, convolutional coding (viterbi), interleaving, qam modulation and white noise channel impairments.

**qam16_satellite_link.m** is a link simulation that includes qam modulation, transmit/receive rrc filtering, a memoryless nonlinear power amplifier, modeled antennas and automatic gain control aswell as compensation/corrections of the impairments. The channel is modeled with a free space loss, doppler error and IQ imbalances.
